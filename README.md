# autoList
A program in Go that automatically generates a grocery list based on selected recipes. 


## AIM 
- The point of this project is to streamline the process of creating a grocery list from a collection of recipes that one wishes to make. This is mostly for me, as I pull recipes from many different sources and compile them into a long list. I categorize them appropirately over time, and now this project will help me quickly derive a grocery list from whichever recipes I want to pick from my list. 
- I also wanted to learn Go, so I decided to do this in Go, given that implementing this in python could have been orders of magnitude faster.
